+# Task Completion Summary: PR #196 Validation
+
+**Issue**: https://github.com/dofaromg/flow-tasks/pull/196  
+**Task**: Validate the Wire-Memory Integration implementation  
+**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**  
+**Date**: 2026-01-02
+
+## What Was Done
+
+Since PR #196 was already merged to the main branch, this task focused on **comprehensive validation** of the implementation.
+
+### Validation Activities
+
+1. ✅ **C Wire Protocol Testing**
+   - Compiled with gcc using strict flags (-Wall -Wextra -pedantic)
+   - Result: Zero warnings, clean build
+   - Ran all 8 unit tests
+   - Result: 8/8 tests PASSED
+
+2. ✅ **Python Integration Testing**
+   - Ran comprehensive integration test suite
+   - Result: 5/5 tests PASSED
+   - Validated round-trip conversion (Python → Wire → Python)
+   - Verified Chinese character handling
+
+3. ✅ **CLI Functionality Testing**
+   - Tested `memory_quick_mount.py` snapshot creation
+   - Tested state rehydration
+   - Result: All CLI commands working correctly
+
+4. ✅ **Demo Validation**
+   - Ran `particle_wire_bridge.py` demo
+   - Verified hex dump output
+   - Confirmed conversion logging works
+
+5. ✅ **Documentation Review**
+   - Verified completeness (825 lines total)
+   - Confirmed bilingual support (中文/English)
+   - Checked all examples work
+
+### Deliverables
+
+1. **VALIDATION_SUMMARY_PR196.md** - Comprehensive validation report including:
+   - Detailed test results
+   - Performance observations
+   - Security considerations
+   - Production readiness assessment
+
+2. **This summary** - Quick reference for task completion
+
+## Test Results
+
+| Component | Tests | Status | Notes |
+|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
+| C Wire Protocol | 8/8 | ✅ PASSED | Zero warnings |
